# Design Decisions

## D-001: Agent sends data out instead of a VPN tunnel
Context: the proposal uses an HA VPN tunnel into each customer network.
Options: HA VPN per site; agent calling the cloud over HTTPS.
Choice: outbound HTTPS with a per-site token for the prototype.
Reason: same goal (encrypted, customer network never exposed) at no cost; HA VPN stays the production design.

## D-002: What latency and packet loss measure
Context: the API has one latency_ms and one packet_loss_pct per reading, but the agent can ping both the router and a public address.
Options: public address only; router only; public address with the router as an extra local reading.
Choice: latency_ms and packet_loss_pct measure the public address (1.1.1.1). The router is pinged separately and shown as a local-only reading.
Reason: the public address reflects what staff experience; the router reading can later tell an office network problem from an internet provider problem.

## D-003: "Destination host unreachable" counts as packet loss
Context: Windows ping counts an "unreachable" reply from the router as a received packet.
Options: follow Windows; count it as lost.
Choice: count it as lost.
Reason: following Windows would under-report outages, for example showing 25% loss instead of 50%.
